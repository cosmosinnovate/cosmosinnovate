Taban is the CTO & Co-Founder of Guide, the B2B Learning & Talent Development platform helping remote teams and 1B+ knowledge workers learn anytime, anywhere, on-demand. He is a Sudanese refugee, an accomplished global technology and product leader, and a world-renowned public speaker!

In 2020, Taban founded CosmosInnovation, a software solutions company working across healthcare, logistics, e-learning, financial technology, blockchain, machine learning, and quantum computing to build scalable innovations for the future.

Being raised by his now-deceased Sudanese immigrant parents while living in a war-torn Sudan is what motivates him every single day to build a powerful legacy that gives those with limited opportunities access to life-changing opportunities in technology.
He became passionate about entrepreneurship and innovation because of the impact of his deceased Sudanese parents who always fostered a mindset of creative thinking, entrepreneurship, and grit within him since he was a child. As a world-renowned technology leader and software architect, Taban advises CEOs, CTOS, start-up founders, and universities on how they can build scalable software solutions by leveraging emerging technology.

As the CTO & Co-Founder of Guide, he leads a distributed organization re-imagining enterprise learning and talent development and serving underserved communities through education and technology access to building an equitable workforce and education system.
Taban is devoting his life to creating opportunities for the next generation of innovators and creators underrepresented. His life mission is to invest in people who want to change the world through technology and innovation.
